Setup the react environment

## Release 1.1:

Make a HTML file (index.html) and javascript file (helloWorld.js) .

Import all necessary modules in the `.js` file and create a React component which displays "Hello world". Look into [this](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html)

Now render that component into html page

## Release 2:

Now use JSX template instead of using regular javascript and build same as above

## Release 3:

Now use `create-react-app` tool to make react setup and build the same Hello world application.

`create-react-app` is a tool built by developers at Facebook to help you build React applications.

To use `create-react-app` tool you need to first install using `npm install create-react-app`

Read through [`create-react-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app)

## Hint: 

To create react component you can use `createReactClass()`. Look at [React without ES6](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-es6.html).

You will learn about Components in detail in the next chapter.
